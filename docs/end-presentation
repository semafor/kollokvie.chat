OUTLINE:

INTRODUCTION: SUBJECT & TEAM
Team
	- Team is candidates 157 and 152
	- Candidate 157 is acting stakeholder
	- We are both developers, testers and designers

Background
	- Students often need a chat tool as primary communication tool
	- Social media has been frequently used in group projects as tool for communication and collaboration
		- This raises privacy issues
		- Can be very distracting when chats with friends are mixed with chat with students
	- Unfortunate mix of private life and studies
	- E.g. Facebook is not academia friendly (no formulas, no possible future integration with Mitt UiB
	- Chat in the cloud, accessible to the web browser, is extremely popular since it gives persitency and ease of access anywhere
		- mobil, tablet, pc, etc
	- Trouble communicating in student projects in the past

Goals
	- To make a free, online, easy-to-use chat tool targeted at students and student projects.
	- Be able to create groups
	- Chat directly with a fellow student
	- maximize privacy
	- security as a primary focus
	- Be a good alternative solution to social media
	- 

METHODS
	- Kanban
		- Kanban was interpreted by us to be an element of lean
		- Easy to combine with agile development
		- Why? Easy to use and learn, forces us to identify the value of the project
		- Works well for small teams
		- Little overhead (må jobbe med kanban-cards)
		- Mixed with a concept of “sprints”

	- A trello board
		- Used view, create and manage tasks
		- Be updated on what the other one is doing

	- Github and open source
		- Kollokvie.chat is open source
		- Open source can in itself be a development methodology where a community can be established

	- Heuristic Evaluation
		- Performed heuristic evaluation near the end of the project

	- TDD (Test Driven Development)
		- The project has 50 tests, most of which were written before the implementation of some aspect of the system

MATERIAL: WHERE DID YOU DATA COME FROM
Hvilke beslutning vi har tatt og hva vi har basert dette på:
	- previous experiences
	- kanban-paper
	- wsgi whitepaper https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/
	- slack (slack.com)
	- facebook.com
	- 

RESULTS
	- Demo
	- Basic chat, you are able to communicate with fellow students logged in to kollokvie chat
	- It's online, you can access it from anywhere
	- We preserve your privacy, we don't sell our data

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:
	- Provide functionality to delete of all your data if you chose to (unlike social media)
	- Smilies, attachments like images, documents and presentations
	- Integration into mitt uib (which is also an open source project)
	- HTTPS certificates for heightened security

DISCUSSION
	- Have we reached our goal?
		- We've made a basic tool for collaboration
		- Long way to go
	- Could this work for students?
		- Yes… but
		- Pragmatic students would choose something else (e.g. Facebook)
		- Students keen on ditching facebook could very well use it
		- It would not meet all the expectations of the user, smilies, pictures, etc.
	- How did Kanban work out?
		- Kanban, as a tool for accomplishing lean, has worked well
		- Trello is an excellent tool for managing tasks and implementing Kanban
	- Challenges
		- Only two candidates on a relatively large task
		- Sticking to plan, quite ambitious
		- Candidate 152 had to learn Github, HTML/CSS and Python
		- Bugs, as the project developed, bugs was introduced, and being only two leaves little time for bugs
	- Things we could've done differently
		- we could have used java, since both students were familiar with it
		- on the other hand, java could end in a more complex code base


CONCLUSION
	- It has been a success
	- We have both learned a lot about system development and the tools used (Python, sql, html, css, javascript, web servers, git, github, command line tools) 
	- The idea of kollokvie.chat is a very good one with regards to collaboration between students, privacy and security.
	- It is open source, free and <something>
	- Better solution for students who studies at university.
	- Aim to communicate with other students to share ideas and information
